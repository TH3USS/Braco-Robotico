# Robotic Arm :mechanical_arm:

This is a project developed by me and two friends, [Yuri](https://github.com/oYuriyan) and [Thomas](https://github.com/thhhhomas), where we program a Robotic Arm using an Arduino UNO.

### What is an Arduino?
Arduino is a single-board programmable prototyping platform with free hardware, where you can make small projects and robotic prototypes. Arduino is an easy and simple way to learn robotics and programming. Arduino has its own IDE (integrated development environment) for programming, in which its default language is C/C++. There are different types of Arduinos, and the one used in this project is the UNO.

The Arduino IDE can be downloaded from the link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

## Let's go Jaqueline!
Jaqueline is the name we nicknamed our Robotic Arm!! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
It can move forward and backward, up and down, open and close the handle and rotate on its base to the right and left. The material used to assemble it were laser-cut MDF pieces. The arm is ready and even with the pieces can easily be found for sale on the internet. :+1:

To assemble the circuits you need:
* An Arduino UNO;
* Jumpers (colored wires, can be found in "male-male", "female-male" or "female-female" formats) that will be used according to the need;
* Four 180Â° Servo Motors;
* A control with Infrared;
* Two Joysticks;
* An Infrared sensor;
* A Proto-Board;

> *~Some parts require libraries to be used, the servo motor is one of them. The library used can be downloaded from the internet or through the IDE in the extensions tab.*
